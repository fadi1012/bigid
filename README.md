# bigid Task - solved with python3

# steps to run locally:
- 1) you can run mock_data_generator.py locally but activating bigidvenv is needed:
-     source bigidvenv/bin/activate
-     python mock_data_generator.py
- after running from clean env you'll see a new json file that contains the mock data

- 2) you can run docker container :
-     docker build -t mockdatagenerator .
-     docker run -ti mockdatagenerator

- solution of the first question is found in task1.md
